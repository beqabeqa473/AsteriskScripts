Scripts for asterisk voice chat.

I was developing voice chat for blind people based on asterisk which purpose was to use some entertainment features directly from their cellphones without using internet.
I stopped developing and maintaining whole thing because of changes in personal life and decided to open-source some parts of it, because i think there are some interesting and non-standard solutions for some features.
