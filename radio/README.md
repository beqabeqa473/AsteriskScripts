# Radio player for asterisk

this is a radio player for asterisk.
confbridge, asterisk realtime for music_on_hold classes, php/mysql and ael for dialplan are used.
Code is very dirty because when i was writing this, i didn't know asterisk internals very well and if something started working i was leaving this part.

# todo
Code working with database should be rewritten with oop using pdo.
Whole script should be rewritten to oop style
sql schema should be added
A web based editor for managing radio stations should be added.
